      <p class="explain-world">Besides the tutorial, there isn't actually any World 0. I want to have this little section here to
        have tips and guides about some basic game mechanics so the World 1 section doesnt feel
        so cluttered. The most important things to understand are going to be afk gains and the
        difference between active and afk.</p>

      <p id="Presets" class="subtitle">Presets</p>
      <p class="subtitle-description">When a character reaches class level 15 they will have the ability to swap between 2
        different talent presets while in a town. This means you don't have to make a build where
        you have fighting and skilling talents or have to use talent reset potions everyday.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">Most players typically use one preset for fighting and the other preset for skilling.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">If you switch between devices you may notice that your talent preset (and card presets) work
        a bit weird. That is because only your active preset is saved to the cloud while any others
        are saved to your device. If you switch devices the new device won't have that inactive
        preset saved anywhere and assumes it is empty.</p>
 
        <p id="Intro-To-Talents" class="subtitle">Into to Talents</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">Throughout the game a huge source of your progress will be determined by your build,
          especially at the very beginning. Unfortunately, talents have a lot of downright terrible
          choices so it's not uncommon for new players to have points into HP and Mana and wonder
          why they can't do damage. Because of this, it's recommended to at least check out builds
          even if you don't follow them exactly.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">You can find the starter class builds in this guide as well. For <a href="TODO">Warriors</a>, <a href="TODO">Archers</a>, and <a href="TODO">Mages</a>.</p>

        <p id="Characters" class="subtitle">Characters</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">You can unlock up to 10 different characters in the game currently. Each character benefits
          from quite a few different account wide mechanics. The storage chest, stamps, forge, and
          even the statues (after using an item from World 2). So as you progress through the game
          each new character will start off stronger and stronger. Your 10th character could be farming
          world 3 within an hour of unlocking them.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">For your second character that means they can slave away at skills to help make sure your
          first character can push through worlds 1 and 2 as quickly as possible.</p>


        <p id="AFK" class="subtitle">AFK</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">Once you get to level 6 you will be able to make more characters for your account, which
          then asks the question of what does your character do when you're looking at someone
          else? If you go to the bottom right of the screen and open up the menu → afk info→ (should
          be simple enough with an arrow like that imo ), there will be an option that says "afk gains." If
          you open it, it will tell you exactly what your character will earn every hour you are afk. If
          you're fighting the game will use several values to determine how many kills you should get
          per hour. This can be increased with more damage and from having certain talents on yiur
          action bar.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">The important things to look at if you're going to AFK while fighting is your Accuracy and
          Survivability. Both of these stats are basically direct multipliers to what you will get while afk.
          If you only hit the monster 50% of the time then you're only going to be killing 50% of the
          mobs you should be. To increase this you can check the beginning of the build guide.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">Survivability is the game trying to calculate if you can survive in your current area. There's 2
          ways to max this out to 100%. The first is to simply have enough defence to not take any
          damage. While this is possible during world 1, it will become harder and harder until it
          becomes impossible at the start of world 3. The other way is to use healing. Early on the star
          talent Goblet of Hemoglobin can sustain you quite well. Halfway through world 2 you will
          most likely have to start buying food from the shop to stay alive while afk.</p>

        <p id="Active-vs-AFK" class="subtitle">Active vs AFK</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">Active/AFK terms are used quite differently in Idleon than in other games. Most games would
          consider you AFK if you are, well, Away From your Keyboard. Usually it doesn't matter if the
          game is open or not, if you're not on your device, you're AFK. In Idleon though you're
          considered Active if your game is on, whether or not you're actually playing. So if you leave
          your device running Idleon overnight while you're asleep, you would be considered to be
          actively playing on the character you were left on. In this scenario you would then be
          considered to be AFKing on all of your other characters. If you left your device off all night
          then you would be AFKing all of your characters.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">The distinction between Active and AFK is very important because the game functions
          differently between the two. When you are fighting monsters you have to run around to kill
          them, sometimes while using abilities to help you. While the game does try to put numbers to
          things like how fast you can kill monsters and how fast you should be able to travel to kill
          said monsters, it's neither perfect nor generous. Some abilities in the game are completely
          ignored in the AFK calculations. The game also typically undersells how many monsters you
          would kill with the best damage. Crystals monsters, which have their own section, are
          exclusive to Active play. They're not too important early on, but as you reach farther into the
          game they become extremely important. Because of all this, even reaching 100% AFK gains
          you still would be better off fighting monsters actively.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-description">Active/AFK skilling has the opposite problem: 100% AFK gains usually gives you more than
          active play. This is because the numbers for skilling are very simple and are accurately used
          in the afk formula. If you have 150% AFK gains for a skill, then you would be getting 50%
          more resources while AFK than you would while active. On top of that, rare drops from the
          rare drop bags don't seem to drop while Active, so you will miss out on that while active.</p>
